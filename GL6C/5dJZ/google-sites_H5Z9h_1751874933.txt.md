# Demo Maintenance

We have several [demo applications](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-docs/tree/main/demos/palm) hosted in this repository that are referenced in the [AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/develop/sample-apps) site. We're looking to the community to help maintain them. 
Thank you in advance for your contributions!

## Responsibilities

While we would love to accept any meaningful contributions to the demos, some tasks we'd particularly like help with include:
1. Create a process to verify that the app works as desired after any changes are made (preferably automated, but a manual testing process works well to start)
2. Get dependencies up-to-date
3. Review and fix any outstanding issues and PRs (you can filter by the `demos:XYZ` [label](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-docs/labels?q=demos%3A))
4. Migrate from PaLM to Gemini

## Next Steps

If you're interested and commited to maintaining one of the demos, please complete the following:
- Read through the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Start work on the responsibilities above.
- Once you have some progress demonstrated, submit a PR to add your GitHub handle next to the demo you're interested in maintaining, in the section below.
- Non-responsive maintainers will be removed without notice.
